# ark_printf
Just a regular and simple printf function.

Don't hesitate to use it to compare with your own printf function.
I might add more things to it later (like float and flags management).

I do not claim to be the best or anything, I made a simple thing that (should) work most of the time.
At least it passed Moulinette's tests.
